# Quickdine
"Quick Dine" is a smart restaurant seating system that detects whether a chair is occupied or free using a load cell sensor and an HX711 amplifier. The system measures weight on the chair and compares it to a threshold to determine occupancy, displaying the result (“Occupied” or “Free”) on a I2C LCD. It helps automate seat availability monitoring.
